# Snapmaker 2.0 A350 Files

This is my archive of files for the Snapmaker 2.0 A350. At the moment, that primarily means my Cura 3D printing profiles. In the future, I may add profiles for other slicers, and possibly CNC and laser-related files, as well as potential upgrades you might want to print to improve the features of your Snapmaker 2.0.

All my final releases will go into this repository, so be sure to keep checking back for updates - and I will be updating the Cura files as I keep printing, testing and tweaking.

## Cura Profiles

Currently, there are screenshots of machine settings for the Snapmaker 2.0 A350 for Cura 3.6 and Cura 4.8 as well as downloadable cura settings profiles for both versions. There is a video (coming soon!) to go along with these profiles as well.

The only thing I haven't finalised yet are the "Printhead Settings" section (my printer's just been too busy printing and I keep forgetting to measure it when it's not). But, these are only important if you're printing multiple models with the "Print Sequence" set to "One at a time". If you're printing multiple models with it set to "All at once" then they are irrelevant. I will fill them in at some point, though. :)

***Disclaimer** : The [official position from Snapmaker](https://support.snapmaker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044341034-What-is-the-recommended-3D-printing-settings-in-Cura-or-Simplify3D-for-Snapmaker-2-0-) is that if 3rd party software (which includes slicing software like Cura) kills your printer, then your warranty is void. So, while I don't expect any of these files to have negative issues on your printer (they don't with mine) you still use them at your own risk.*
