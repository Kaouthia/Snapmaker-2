# Snapmaker 2.0 A350 Files

This is my archive of files for the Snapmaker 2.0 A350. At the moment, that primarily means my Cura 3D printing profiles. In the future, I may add profiles for other slicers, and possibly CNC and laser related files, as well as potential upgrades you might want to print to improve the features of your Snapmaker 2.0.

All official releases will go into this repository, so be sure to keep checking back for updates - and I will be updating the Cura files as I keep printing, testing and tweaking.
